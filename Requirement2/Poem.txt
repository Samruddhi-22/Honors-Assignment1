In the silence of the night, the stars ignite,
Whispers of the wind, a gentle flight.
Moonlight dances on the waves so bright,
Nature's symphony, a pure delight.

Mountains stand tall, against the sky,
Birds in chorus, as they fly.
Each moment, a fleeting sigh,
In this grand world, we wonder why.

Through the trials, we find our way,
In the warmth of love, we sway.
Dreams take flight, come what may,
In the beauty of life, we find our day.
